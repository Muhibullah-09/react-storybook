What is StoryBook?
Storybook is a tool for UI development. It makes development faster and easier 
by isolating components. This allows you to work on one component at a time. 
You can develop entire UIs without needing to start up a complex dev stack, 
force certain data into your database, or navigate around your application.

WHY and WHAT?
1) A development enviroment and playground for UI components.
2) Create components independently.
3) Showcase those components interactively in an isolated development enviroment.

PRACTICALLY:
a) Ability to view the different components that have already been developed.
b) View what are the different props that those developed components accept.
c) Ability to visually showcase those components to your stake holders for feedback.
d) Dynamically change props , accessibility score.
